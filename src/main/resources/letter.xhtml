<div class="pageBody">Dear Friend,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to St. Andrew's Website. The website will inform you about our mission and ministry as a Christian community in Halifax.  <br/>
<br/>
The congregation is typical of many churches with people who have known no other fellowship and others who have come from different towns, cultures and contexts.<br/>
<br/>
At the heart of all we do is a love for Jesus Christ.  Our mission is to share the Love of God as revealed by Christ, through the Holy Spirit. <br/>
<br/>
Through different styles of worship and witness we proclaim our faith; we deepen our understanding through Bible study and fellowship groups; we encourage fellowship and friendship through the many activities<br/>
<br/>
Our weekly notice sheet gives details of many more opportunities to meet, to pray, to study, to eat together, play together and grow in faith.<br/>
<br/>

We will soon be running Christianity Explored. The course gives you time and space to consider the big questions of life and to explore the life of the person at the heart of the Christian faith - Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
You don't need to know anything about the Bible.<br/>
You won't be asked to read aloud, pray or sing.<br/>
You can ask any question you want, or just listen. <br/><br/>
We start the course on Tuesday 9th April and meet every Tuesday evening at 7.00 p.m.  Please contact us for more details.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to know more about our church we would be pleased to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
Every blessing<br/>
<br/>
