Worship and Spiritual Growth Task Force
</div>

<div class="pageBody">
The Worship and Spiritual Growth Task Force meets on a quarterly basis ahead of the date for submission of the
Circuit Plan to consider the following: -<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Review the previous plan and provide feedback on the services held, particularly any special ones that we have had.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		What do we want to include in the next plan or further in the future: -
		<ul>
			<li>Styles of worship</li>
			<li>The variety of services</li>
			<li>Invitation of preachers for special services</li>
			<li>Planned preaching themes</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul> 
In everything that we think about we are mindful of the congregational mix at St Andrew&acute;s and the differing needs that that brings.&nbsp;
We therefore look at how this can be accommodated and how we can encourage others on the fringes of the church to attend worship.&nbsp;<br/>
